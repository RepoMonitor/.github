## About RepoMonitor

RepoMonitor was founded in 2022 by a Student who was frustrated with the lack of comprehensive repository monitoring tools available on the market. We set out to create a platform that would not only track changes and updates to repositories, but also provide valuable insights and analysis to help developers and organizations make informed decisions.

## Our Mission

We believe that by providing real-time data and analysis, we can help teams improve their collaboration, productivity, and overall success.

## Features

- Real-time monitoring of repository activity
- Detailed analysis and reporting on repository changes
- Notifications and alerts for important updates
- Integration with popular tools and platforms such as GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket
- Customizable settings and preferences to fit your team's needs
